# Welcome

Welcome to this course on prompt engineering! 

I like to think of prompt engineering (PE) as: **How to talk to AI to get it to do what you want**. 



With many of the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI),
this has become a particularly important skill.
This course focuses on applied PE techniques. Minimal knowledge of 
machine learning is expected. If you have no idea what any of this stuff means, read the Introduction in Basics.

## The single most important part of this course is your feedback!
If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please make an **[issue](https://github.com/trigaten/Learn_Prompting/issues/new/choose)**, email me at learnprompting@gmail.com, or reach out over [Discord](https://learnprompting.org/discord)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/learn_prompting).

Even the smallest amount of feedback is very helpful!

## Course philosophy

**Quick Iterations** - Since new PE content is published almost daily, 
I will update this course frequently with short articles about new techniques.
Let me know what you want to hear more about!

Part of this philosophy is **error iteration**. If you ever see something that you
don't quite understand, even something small, that's on me. **Please make an [issue](https://github.com/trigaten/Learn_Prompting/issues/new/choose)**!

**Focus on Practicality** - I will focus on applied, practical techniques that you can use
immediately for your applications.

**Examples ASAP** - I try to put examples in the articles as soon as possible,
so you can get a feel for the techniques as soon as possible.

I'll philosophize more about this when I have time ðŸ˜Š

## How to read

It is not necessary to read all chapters in order. Read what interests you!

If you are a complete novice, read below then start with the Basics section.
If not, starting with the Intermediate section may be more useful.

Articles are rated by difficulty, and are labeled with the following:

ðŸŸ¢ Very easy; no programming required

ðŸŸ¡ Easy; simple programming required, but no domain expertise

ðŸ”´ Medium; programming required, and some domain expertise to implement (e.g. computing log probs)

ðŸŸ£ Hard; programming required, and robust domain expertise to implement (e.g. reinforcement learning approaches)

Note: even though for ðŸ”´ðŸŸ£ problems domain expertise is helpful, usually you will still
be able to understand the article.

## Chapters

Here is a quick summary of each chapter:

**Basics**: Intro to PE and simple PE techniques

**Intermediate**: Slightly more complicated PE techniques

**Applied Prompting**: Some complete walkthroughs of the PE process written by community members

**Advanced Applications**: Some very powerful, but more advanced applications of PE

**Reliability**: How to make LLMs more reliable

**Images**: PE for text to image models like DALLE and Stable Diffusion!

**Prompt Injection**: Hacking, but for PE

**Prompting IDEs**: Different PE tools

**Prompt Tuning**: Fine tune prompts with gradients
